# ⏳ Waiting for Your Supabase Credentials

## 🎯 What I Need From You:

Go to: https://supabase.com/dashboard

1. **Create new project** (takes 2 minutes)
2. **Copy 2 values** from Project Settings → API:
   - **Project URL** (looks like: `https://xxxxx.supabase.co`)
   - **anon/public key** (long string starting with `eyJh...`)

---

## 📋 Send Me Exactly This:

```
SUPABASE_URL=https://xxxxx.supabase.co
SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=eyJhbGci...
```

---

## ✅ What I'll Do Immediately:

1. Add credentials to Vercel (10 seconds)
2. Create database tables automatically (30 seconds)
3. Insert your Instagram connection (10 seconds)
4. Deploy to production (1 minute)
5. **Test and verify Instagram shows connected** (30 seconds)

**Total time: 3 minutes**

---

## 🚀 After Setup:

Your Instagram connection will:
- ✅ **Always show as connected** in UI
- ✅ **Persist forever** (not deleted like files)
- ✅ **Work for AI replies** automatically
- ✅ **Support multiple users** if you add them
- ✅ **Never disappear** on deployment

---

## 💡 Why This Is The REAL Fix:

**Current (Broken):**
```
Environment Variables → Can't store user profiles → UI always shows 0
```

**With Supabase (Fixed):**
```
Environment Variables → Populate Supabase → Store user profiles → UI shows connected ✅
```

## 🔑 Important Notes:

1. **Database Password**: Supabase will ask you to create one - SAVE IT! (You won't need to give it to me)
2. **Region**: Choose Mumbai or Singapore for faster performance in India
3. **Project Name**: Can be anything (e.g., "salespilots")
